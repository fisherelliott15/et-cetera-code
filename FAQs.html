            <p>
              Nearby are a few garages off Race street. Also adjacent to the building is a paid lot that is open most days.

          <h1>Any vegan options?</h1>
          <p>
            unfortunatly, there are no truly vegan options since all of our soup stocks are made with animal product. Sorry!
